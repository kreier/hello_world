# hello world in Python and JavaScript

This is our first repository in Advanced Automation at SSIS in 2022-2023.

## Python

This is the code. You can highlight ``code`` elements with two symbols, and mask it like ``this example`` in line. Or you make a code block:

``` py
def greeting():
  print("This is my greeting!")

print("Hello world!")
```

## JavaScript

This is the code.
